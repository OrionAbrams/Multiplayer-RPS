# Multiplayer-RPS
Rock Paper Scissors multiplayer using firebase. The user can play on one computer by himself or herself, or can play against others. Everyone connected to the site uses the same firebase and it updates in real time for everyone. Anyone can click Reset Game to clear the score and the names for player 1 and player 2.

# Motivation
It was a homework for Berekeley Extension Bootcamp that I ended up enjoying quite a bit and since it was my first time, took around 10 hours to finish.
